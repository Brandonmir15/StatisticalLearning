# Statistical Learning Notebooks

This project contains my notes, exercises, and visualizations based on the Introduction to Statistical Learning textbook.
All code examples and illustrations are written in Python, with a focus on building intuition through clear visual explanations.

## Contents: 

- Python implementations of key concepts

- Step-by-step walkthroughs of textbook exercises

- Visualizations to help understand statistical learning methods

- Jupyter notebooks organized by chapter

## Goal

To create a practical and easy-to-follow companion to the Statistical Learning textbook, reinforcing concepts through coding and visualization.
